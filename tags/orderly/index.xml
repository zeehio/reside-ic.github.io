      <description>We are pleased to announce the first public release of orderly, our reproducible reporting framework, implemented as an R package and now available on CRAN.
The orderly package was designed to help with a common pattern in reporting, where a piece of analysis might be run multiple times (over say a number of weeks or months) and where the inputs to the analysis might change. Any piece of analysis has numerous inputs (data &amp;amp; metadata, source code &amp;amp; packages) and changes in any of these might change the results of the analysis.</description>
